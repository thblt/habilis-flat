#+TITLE: Yet another keyboard

A keyboard, nothing exceptional.  This is mostly an intermediate step
for layout-testing the [[https://github.com/thblt/habilis][Habilis]].

Schematic and PCB (KiCad 7) are in =pcb/=, firmware lives in =fw/=.
The firmware is QMK, so should be symlinked in the correct location:

#+begin_example
ln -s ~/PATH/TO/REPO/habilis-flat/fw ~/qmk_firmware/keyboards/habilis-flat
#+end_example
